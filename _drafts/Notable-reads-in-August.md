* [The Goblin Emperor](goodreads.com/book/show/17910048-the-goblin-emperor) by Katherine Addison
	*Sometimes you pick up a book and within a few pages, sometimes a few paragraphs, you know you are in for a good read. Though the end was a bit pat, and everyone turned out nice except the obvious bad ones, it was still a total pleasure to read. I especially enjoyed that this was just one book - supposedly a companion novel is being considered, but not a sequel. This gives me room to wonder at what happens with Maia's impending marriage, does he see his grandfather again, does he figure out how to meditate in privacy, etc etc etc.
