The best time to become a fantasy reader is when you are a child. That's not to say you can't become one when older - change is possible at any age (besides obvious physical limitations when very young or old, and even then, the body is surprising.) For one, the vast majority of children's literature, and an even greater percentage of picture books aimed at pre-readers, has fantastical elements, so to go straight from there into fantasy is an easy skip jump hop. Secondly, kids don't know what the 'known' limitations of the world are and so, they are willing to suspend disbelief at the drop of a hat. Plus it's fun to suspend disbelief, as they well know. And lastly, kids are very open to learning new things and are ok with not understanding everything about a situation, a sentence, an idea, and still forging ahead. The young mind is a flexible one. 

Jo Walton's idea of a "SF Skillset" that the typical SF reader has (and she means SF to include Fantasy as well as Science Fiction) resonates with me. And it seems other writers have written about it as well - Samuel R Delany, Walter Jon Williams, to name two. 

Take the current story I'm reading, Katherine Addison's [The Goblin Emperor](goodreads.com/book/show/17910048-the-goblin-emperor).
