“Whatever you’re meant to do, do it now. The conditions are always impossible.” ― Doris Lessing, quoted by [The Write Now podcast](http://www.sarahwerner.com/write-now-podcast/)

I don't know if I'm meant to write, but I like it and I want to, and and and. So, I did, over 2000 words today, just now. The real goal is to write regularly though, aiming for every day, and if I hit five days a week I will be extremely pleased. Writing so much is about falling over and over again and just getting up each time and trying again.
