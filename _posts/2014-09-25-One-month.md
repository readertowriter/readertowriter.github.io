To celebrate, two quotes I like that are recently quite relevant:

"Routine, in an intelligent man, is a sign of ambition." - W. H. Auden

"Some stories can be like sculptures and your eyes can just follow its contours." - Amal El-Mohtar

Note: I've only had this little site going for a month so far, but already I've written more in September than in the previous three months. Onward and upward!
