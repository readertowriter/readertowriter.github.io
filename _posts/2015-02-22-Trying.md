I'm trying to be different things at the same time. I don't really believe in balance in any more, not when it comes to life and projects and all that. I know if I don't read or make something every once in a while, regularly, then I get angry and mean. If I don't stretch weekly at least, go for a long walk, something, then I feel achey and old and miserable. As a result, I make time for these things, though "making something" can mean cooking a new meal, so that particular need is very flexible. Anyhow, I don't consider that balance achieved, because it turns out I'm quite ambitious. I want to be good at everything I do - really good. Right now, it means parent, spouse, child, house-proud adult, politically-aware(kinda), in shape, friendly, and, lastly, writer. Nothing there can go really, everything there is crucial. Maybe the friendly and child bit, but not really. Argh.
