So, I'm over 5000 words behind in NaNoWriMo - that just happened in the last two days or so. More importantly, I really don't know where to go with what I'm writing. I was surprised a week ago when I wrote down a rough outline of what I'd written so far and discovered there was a plot there, somewhat. It didn't feel like a single thing had happened except for some lovely atmosphere. I'm very interested in going against the whole 3-act structure typical kind of plot, or in not having some super-villian, or any villian at all, but I do feel like things have to move and change or else what is the point! Another way of looking at what I have already is that I'm all over the place - which I remind myself is absolutely fine for a 100% pantsing first draft. Energy-wise, this is getting harder to keep up - in the past three weeks, I've written six days a week for at least an hour or two. Stymied, that's what I am. And tired.

But, I am not giving up. It feels too good when I do write something I like, even if it's just a phrase or an image, not even a whole paragraph. And when I re-read what I wrote, it isn't as bad as I fear. Let's hope that continues. Onward and upward...
