title: Rejection		
---

Now that I have some time to consider it, now that the immediate reaction to it has subsided, I'm glad my story was rejected. There was value in submitting it - it was so difficult for me to even do that, to format and write an accompanying note, and then to actually really hit the submit button.. It's nerve-wracking to just remember. 

Even more importantly though, that submission - and the following one that I'm still waiting on a reply - they forced me to look seriously at what I was submitting. One would think that I had done that before submitting, and I did, but I don't know, it pushed me to another level of seriousness. Of taking myself seriously. I had studied the story, see, but I hadn't studied what I wanted, what I was really doing, what I was starting.

And so now, of course, I worry that my writing is crap. I know the ideas are good, I am sure of that, but I'm worried I have all the most newbie writing errors (telling &amp; not showing, no plot, etc etc) and that it will take years and years before I will be able to fix them and let the ideas show as they should. 

In a positive way of looking at it, I guess I'm more ambitious now. I am not satisfied at the idea of just publishing one or two or even a dozen short stories - there are so many markets, I'm sure I could accomplish that within a few years or so. I want to write stories that are award-winning. And I want to write novels. (I have a feeling I'm more of a novel writer, but I'm admiring more and more the mastery needing to write short stories and anyhow it is definitely a more economical way of generally learning the craft of writing.) And I want those novels to be award-winning too, and published by my favorite presses, to boot. And and and.

Ambition. It's an odd taste in my mouth, I feel like I haven't been ambitious in years. But of course it's really intimidating too. I could never reach it - I'm in my late thirties, for one. It might be too late. So, that's what I'm struggling with right now. Feeling too late &amp; too old, but still ambitious - and just feeling that I really *could* do this, reach that, if I wanted to. And I do.
