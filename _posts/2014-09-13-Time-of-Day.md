There are writers that have a very set schedule, waking early to write every day at 5:30 am and then a brisk walk and some coffee, etc. That is lovely and I aspire to that kind of consistency in life but I am not there. Writing is not my first priority, nor can it be, but I would like to move it into the number three spot. That is doable, even right now, today. 

For the longest time, I thought a schedule was stifling - too many years of schooling maybe. I remember a discussion in college with a creative friend, and she said she wanted to create x many times a week, so she set aside time for it, but we both wondered whether it was realistic or even right to force creativity to a set schedule. I think I have the answer now - basically, make the space for creativity to arrive, make yourself ready, pen and paper etc. in hand, and sit and write. Write whatever, and sooner or later, your mind, aka creativity, will wonder about this or that and lo and behold, it is there and you are writing something interesting. 

So, the basics: 
	*some space to yourself, dedicated to writing - something pretty or sparse, clean or cluttered;
	*find a block of at least 15 minutes of uninterrupted time;
	*schedule writing time with those 15 minutes - daily, every other day, etc.
	*look at the #amwriting tag on twitter at other times during the day - it works for me at least! if they can do it, so can you. 
	*have your computer/notebook/whatever open and nearby, so when an idea strikes, you can quickly jot it down. You will almost certainly *not* remember the idea later. 
	*imagine your award-accepting speech and decide on book dedications -- ha, just kidding about that part. kinda.
	*finish your story. writing is great but revising is even better so: finish!

Cory Doctorow said, "Writing is something I do every day, a thousand words whethere I feel like it or not...I think writers who rely on inspiration aren't very happy - the thing that makes their idenity isn't in their control. I can't imagine a worse situation." Makes sense to me.
