title: A Beginning

Basically, it comes to this: I want to be a writer. it makes perfect sense in my life, in all ways - creatively, practically, history-wise, mind-wise, and so on. Time is passing though, faster than ever. It's taken me years+ to get to the point where I can say the first line above to myself, sometimes even out loud, but nonetheless after a few weeks or days of steady progress, I lose focus. I get discouraged. I get lazy. Someone gets sick. Drama. I take up yoga. Whatever. Next thing I know, it's been weeks since I've written. I'm always reading and jotting down ideas, but that is not enough to make me a writer. 
 
So, the idea here is to track the progress, the ups and downs of it all. And for me, I've learned that there's something about putting it online - even if no one else ever reads it much less follows along - that makes me *want* to stick to a project. 

Along with progress updates, I'll also talk about books I've read and want to read, writing strategies, themes and trends I'm interested in, time management, goal-setting, and basically anything that gets me excited to write enough that I actually write. 

And that's that.
