title: This Year
---

Last year I read such few books, I barely made it to double digits. Life is always busy, I'm realizing (over and over again), and I have to make the time now for the things I love and may not be important to anyone else but I love them and that is enough. Somewhere in my brain, there's a voice yelling fine don't write, but you're going to drop reading too?! And so, basta, right? A line in the sand and all that. And you know what - 100 rejections this year. That is my goal. There, I said it.
