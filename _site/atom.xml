&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the (pitifully low number of) twenty-one books I&amp;#39;ve read so far this year, I especially liked the twelve listed above. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistics: one is non-fiction, one is a historical western, two are scifi, eight are (arguably) fantasy, four are children&amp;#39;s books (mostly middle grade), and over half were published in the last three years. Nine of the books were written by women, three by men, and only one is written by a non-white person. All are new writers to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for now, I&amp;#39;m in the middle of half a dozen other books, not a good sign usually that I&amp;#39;ll ever finish them, but there&amp;#39;s always hope. I&amp;#39;m also halfway through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/223380.Stories_of_Your_Life_and_Others&quot;&gt;Ted Chiang&amp;#39;s Stories of Your Life and Others&lt;/a&gt;, but I will definitely get through this book as the stories are excellent - I just take my time with short stories. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, a taste of my reading interests.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Beginning</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Basically, it comes to this: I want to be a writer. it makes perfect sense in my life, in all ways - creatively, practically, history-wise, mind-wise, and so on. Time is passing though, faster than ever. It&amp;#39;s taken me years+ to get to the point where I can say the first line above to myself, sometimes even out loud, but nonetheless after a few weeks or days of steady progress, I lose focus. I get discouraged. I get lazy. Someone gets sick. Drama. I take up yoga. Whatever. Next thing I know, it&amp;#39;s been weeks since I&amp;#39;ve written. I&amp;#39;m always reading and jotting down ideas, but that is not enough to make me a writer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the idea here is to track the progress, the ups and downs of it all. And for me, I&amp;#39;ve learned that there&amp;#39;s something about putting it online - even if no one else ever reads it much less follows along - that makes me &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to stick to a project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with progress updates, I&amp;#39;ll also talk about books I&amp;#39;ve read and want to read, writing strategies, themes and trends I&amp;#39;m interested in, time management, goal-setting, and basically anything that gets me excited to write enough that I actually write. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s that.&lt;/p&gt;
