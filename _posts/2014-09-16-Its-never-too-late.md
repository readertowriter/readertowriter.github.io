I go at my own (slow) pace at so many of the big things in life and I'm used to that, but it nevertheless worries me that I am starting out "so late" - hence this helpful list. Looking at the [Campbell Award nominees and winners](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Campbell_Award_for_Best_New_Writer), out of the 174 nominees and winners over theh forty-two years since the award was created, over 50 of the writers were 37 (my age now) or older. There are probably even more but I'm just going on a quick scan of Wikipedia, and it seems especially with recent winners and nominees, their birth year isn't easy to find. Some of these 50 had published non-genre stuff before, but most of them were brand new at this.
