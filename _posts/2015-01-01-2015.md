I've been saying it all day but woah, 2015, it's like we're living in the future! 1995 still doesn't seem old to me, Prince's 1999 still makes me think ooh 1999, a new millenium, how exciting, etc etc. So, 2015? Absolutely the future. And yet here we are, in it. ! I have good feelings about this year.
