title: Notable Reads in November

* ["The Road to Publication"](http://www.jessieburton.co.uk/the-miniaturist---the-road-to-publication.html) by Jessie Burton
	
	My favorite bits: "Writing will enrage you, but it's supposed to. It's not an escape - it's turning up to face myself. I drive myself crazy just by being conscious - writing is the exploration of this fury..." and "Just keep writing and reading; two acts of autonomy and agency, two channels of air to breathe in deep."

* ["The Inner Child and the Nude Politician"](http://www.ursulakleguin.com/Blog2014.html) by Ursula K. Le Guin

	"To respect and cherish the freshness of perception and the vast, polymorphous potentialities of childhood is one thing. But to say that we experience true being only in childhood and that creatifity is an infantil function - that's something else. I keep meeting this devaluation of growing up in fiction,a nd also in the cult of the Inner Child... However conscious we are of the freedom and awareness and joyfullness we lose as we age, we live a full human life not by stopping at any stage, but by becoming all that is in us to become."
