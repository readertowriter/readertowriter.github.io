title: Finishing Things
---

"The reason a woman has greater problems becoming an artist is because she had greater problems becoming a self. She can't believe in her existence past thirty. She can't believe her own voice...  
As long as she goes on taking orders, as long as she doesn't have to tell herself what to do, and be accountable to herself for finishing things... But an artist takes orders only from her inner voice and is accountable only to herself for finishing things. Well, what if you have no inner voice, or none you can distinguish? Or what if you have three inner voices and all three of them are saying conflicting things? Or what if the only inner voice which you can conjure up is male because you can't really conceive of authority as soprano?   
Just about the most common complaint talented women, artists manqu√©, women who aspire to be artists, is that they can't finish things. Partly because finishing implies being judged -- but also because finishing things means being grown up. Most important, it means possibly succeeding at something. And success, for women, is always partly failure.   
Don't get a doctorate because then you'll never find a husband.   
Don't be too successful or men will be scared of you.   
The implication is always that... success at one end brings failure at the other....   
No wonder women are ambivalent about success. Most of them are so ambivalent, in fact, that when success seems imminent they go through the most complex machinations to ward it off. Very often they succeed, too."

-Erica Jong, "The Artist as Housewife", 1972.

Forty years old but wow if much of it isn't still true. (Though, for Jong, the only reasons she could find, or at least list, that women might fear men's reactions at their success was about getting a man/that ring? Yikes.) That part aside, this is full of interesting bits. Most importantly for today and this month: finish things!
