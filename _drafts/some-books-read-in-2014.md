Of the (pitifully low number of) twenty-one  books I've read so far this year, I especially liked the twelve listed above. 

Statistics: one is non-fiction, one is a western, two are scifi, eight are (arguably) fantasy, four are children's books (mostly middle grade), and over half were published in the last three years. Nine of the books were written by women, three by men, and only one is written by a non-white person. All are new writers to me. 

As for now, I'm in the middle of half a dozen other books, not a good sign usually that I'll ever finish them, but there's always hope. I'm also halfway through [Ted Chiang's Stories of Your Life and Others](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/223380.Stories_of_Your_Life_and_Others), but I will definitely get through this book as the stories are excellent - I just take my time with short stories. 

So, a taste of my reading interests.
