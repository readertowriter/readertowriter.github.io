"[Madeline L'Engle] made me curious about the physicality of the Universe - the palpability of the intersection between mathematics and wonder - and she made me convinced that there were things that could not be known. And that the not-knowing was itself a kind of magic." -Kelly Barnhill, [link](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/09/the-pop-quiz-at-the-end-of-the-universe-kelly-barnhill)

"If anything, [A Wrinkle in Time] enchants readers who might not entirely grasp its concepts with the delight in not knowing; the realization that even the most know-it-all kids do not, in fact, have all the answers and that certain questions are worth asking." -[link](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/29/books/review/a-wrinkle-in-time-and-its-sci-fi-heroine.html)
