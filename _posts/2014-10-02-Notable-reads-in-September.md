* [We Have Always Lived in the Castle](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89724.We_Have_Always_Lived_in_the_Castle) by Shirley Jackson

	I love stories where we, the readers, join in after the main drama has already happened - like in Jo Walton's Among Others - and so then we can get to the more interesting part of the fallout or what happens after. 

* ["What Isn't Remembered"](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v479/n7374/full/479562a.html) by Hiromi Goto

	Science fiction the way I like it best lately: small scope, slice of life short story. And I agree, I love sleep too. 

* [Blue Pastures](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199391.Blue_Pastures) by Mary Oliver

	"The words leads us and we follow: what is cute is diminuitive, it is powerlesss, it is capturable, it is trainable, it is ours. It is all a mistake. At our feet are the ferns - savage and resolute they rose, when the race of man was *nowhere* and altogether unlikely ever to be at all, in the terrifying shallos of the first unnamed and unnameable oceans... Nature [is the] total of all of us."	

* ["Story of Your Life"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20553254-story-of-your-life) by Ted Chiang

	I loved the footnote: "As for this story's theme, the most concise summation of it that I've seen appears in Kurt Vonnegut's introduction to the 25th anniversary edition of *Slaughterhouse-Five*: 'Stepehn Hawking...found it tantalizing that we could not remember the future. But remembering the future is child's play for me now. I know what will become of my helpless, trusting babies because they are grown-ups now. I know how my closest friends will end up because so many of them are retired or dead now... To Stephan Hawking and all others younger than myself I say, ' Be patient. Your future will come to you and lie down at your feet like a dog who know sna dloves you no matter what you are.'""	

* [North American Lake Monsters](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16057298-north-american-lake-monsters) by Nathan Ballingrud
	
	I read through these stories slowly, one every few days or so. Spooky, sad, excellent. The imagery of the last story, the only brand new story in the collection, every so often pops into my head, uninvited. 

* "The Fisherwoman's Daughter" by Ursula K. Le Guin, from [Mother Reader](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/797207.Mother_Reader) edited by Moyra Dave
	
	More on this later but for now, know I devoured the essay and added yet more books to read to my already-too-long list - especially Margaret Drabble, Woolf's Common Readers, and Doris Lessing's first memoir Under my Skin. Le Guin is so so good. I would love to hear her speak.

* ["Sleeping with Bears"](http://www.strangehorizons.com/2003/20031117/bears.shtml) by Theodora Goss

	Researching and thinking about [mythpunk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_derivatives#Mythpunk) led me to this story.
