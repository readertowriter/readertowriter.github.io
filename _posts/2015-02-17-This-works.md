With the [blogging system](http://jekyllrb.com/) that I have, it's very easy to publish posts whenever I want, with whatever date I want, so I've found myself often back-dating posts, to fill in a week (or two!) of no new content. Is that cheating? Nah. Anyhow, invariably, when I do finally get around to writing up a bunch of posts, finding illustrations I like, etc., I end up writing. Like writing stories, or fragments at least. 

That is the whole point of this little web space of mine - to get me writing. And it works. Even better, I like what I write. That is still a surprise, but a welcome one.
