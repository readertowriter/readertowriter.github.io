Part of the problem with writing daily is that my schedule right now varies so much. Wednesday and Friday are almost impossible to get any writing done as I'm out of the house or have sole responsibility of the kids. Saturday is often filled with family stuff. So that leaves Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. That doesn't sound too bad, right? But then Sunday is only partially available, kinda, and the other three days have obligations as well, however enjoyable, and then of course every day there is house cleaning, kid caring, some kind of exercise fit in somewhere, and so on. Blah blah blah, right? We all have some version of that, if we're lucky, or that plus more stuf that's not so pleasant. I know that this is a pretty amazing part of life lately. So. 

Really, most of the problem with writing daily is that it's scary. It means I really want this (and what if I don't get it), and I intend to submit stories (and what if no one likes them), and it's going to be hard (and I'm already exhausted), &tc &tc. I keep hoping there's an easy part - but there won't be. Writing first drafts is hard. Rewriting is hard. Revising is hard. Querying is hard. Shopping around a manuscript is hard. Publication is hard too. The second book is hard. 

Basically, you want this? Then, deep breath and dive in.
