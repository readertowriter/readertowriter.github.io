I took the plunge and yes, [NaNoWriMo 2014](http://nanowrimo.org/participants/areadertowriter) is happening. This time around, I'm not as concerned in getting to 50,000 words or writing every day (though I will try) as I am in having a finished story by December 1st, with a distinct beginning, middle, & end. Once I have that, something long enough that there's room to revise, embellish, subtract, something with a decided ending, a goal reached, and even better, characters that have actual names, then I will be so very very happy. 

A writer I shall be! Here's some other writers who started books during NaNoWriMo: Ann Leckie, Erin Morgenstern, Sara Gruen, Rainbow Rowell, Marissa Meyer, Gennifer Albin, Carrie Ryan, Mary Robinette Kowal. Lots more inspiration [here](http://nanowrimo.org/published-wrimos). If they can do it, why can't I.

(Also, this time around, if the goal is reached, I am absolutely printing it out as a book - just for my eyes at this point, but still, oooh that will be rewarding.)
