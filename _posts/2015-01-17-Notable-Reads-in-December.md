title: Notable Reads in December
---

A bit late, and sparse, but here it is:

* [Station Eleven](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20170404-station-eleven) by Emily St. John Mandel

	I really enjoyed this book. I used to just love post-apocalyptic books, but have gotten a bit burned out on them this past decade. This however was a refreshing change. I do agree with many of the criticisms made by Kirstyn from [The Writer and the Critic](http://writerandcritic.podbean.com/e/episode-41-hild-and-station-eleven/) podcast, but ultimately I agreed with her co-host Ian that it was a positive hopeful story. For a genre book written by a non-genre writer (avowedly so it seems), it was really good, beautifully written, and a fast read (always appreciated!)


And that is it! I read a couple of comics and one other book, none of them particularly notable though all enjoyable in their own ways. Mostly, for the month of December I dreamed a lot, was very happy, and basically recharged.
