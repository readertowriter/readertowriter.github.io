I read a lot of fairy tales and fantasy when I was little, and then around age 14, I discovered the world of Pern and fell straight into scifi. In my favorite fairy tales, like the Snow Queen and Hansel and Gretel and so on, the women were all very pro-active, evil and good ones. And in the fantasy I read, a lot of Mercedes Lackey for example, there were women being leaders and heroes *and* mothers and sisters. With the Pern books, looking back I can see some issues that just went over my head at the time, and maybe some I absorbed too, I'm sure, but for the most part Pern was filled to the brim with all kinds of complicated interesting women. 

I think as a result, and also probably because I come from a family with a lot of women in it, I have always veered into reading books by women. And, naturally, when I began to write, it was invariably through the eyes of a female narrator. There are a few exceptions, but they're more difficult for me and almost always the male protagonist is very young or very old. I've read lots of writers saying they had a hard time writing female characters, or that they were surprised to realize they were just writing about men, or that they felt pressure to write only about men in order for their writing to be respected - - and I feel none of that. 

I'm lucky, I know, and I will use that luck for good.
