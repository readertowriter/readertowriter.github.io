So, now I have a complete story, about 51,000 words long. What next? I'm leaving in a week for most of the month of December, and it will be so busy, I will not be able to work on this much. It seems the perfect time to take the much-lauded step back and let the story kinda simmer in my brain without actively thinking about it. Until then, I have a week to do three things:

1) Make a rough outline of the complete story. I want to see the bones of it, see if the rafters can support the roof, etc etc.

2) I finished the story about a week before NaNoWriMo ended. I've read before that if you finish your story in much less words than it should ultimately have (for the format you're writing for) then it means your ideas weren't rich enough or fleshed out enough. But for me, this time, I think it was more that I just really really wanted a complete story and so one day I just found my fingers fast forwarding... and my protagonist died. The End. Hm. She may be ressurected. Anyhow, after that, for the last week of NaNoWriMo, I wrote little scenes and bits to put into previous ones. So, with those bits, about 10,000 words worth, I want to fit them in so that I can read the entire story from first page to last and see how it reads.

3) Print it out. The whole thing. I'm sorry trees, but it will be my first time doing this and it will be so very satisfying to have it in my lap, a nice weight of words.

And then I will enjoy my trip, read a ton, and come back with fresh eyes, ready to work on my story. Yes!
