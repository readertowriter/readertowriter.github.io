<!--Almost a decade ago, I bought a print of Jaime Zollars' work (the first image posted below) at a craft fair in Los Angeles and I remember thinking that if I did ever write a book - though I immediately rejected the idea, too scary - I would want her to illustrate it. I still have that print, and I still love her work. And now, she made the cover to Kate Milford's [Greenglass House](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18222716-greenglass-house)! Well done and here's hoping one day maybe she *will* illustrate a story of mine. You never know. -->
