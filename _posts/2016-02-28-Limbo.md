Maybe I haven't heard from them (the second place I've ever submitted work to) because the email - ack, it just occurred to me, either mine to them, or theirs to me! - got lost somehow. Or they thought they'd responded already. It's probably not because they're still considering it, right. I can't bring myself to re-read what I sent in. It was written in such a flurry, I dread to read it, but in my mind, looking back, it was good, funny, and surprising. Argh. Thirty days waiting and I just keep refreshing and re-refreshing and re-re-etc Submission Grinder. I went through a phase ten days ago or so where I wished it would be rejected. How many times have I read authors rejoicing that their first stories *weren't* published because then they'd be out there, in the internet ether, forever. Hammer of doom. But now, in the past week, I've started to think well, it wouldn't be sooo bad if it was published. Ha. And really, the editor's own short stories and poetry is beautiful and spare and thoughtful and right up my alley magic-wise, it would be a thrill if she thought my writing was good. Ok, ok, deep breath, don't worry, just keep writing and, more importantly, keep editing.
