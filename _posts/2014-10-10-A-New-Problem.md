title: A New Problem
---

So this post will jinx everything but here it is anyhow: I am writing a lot lately, tons of new ideas and situations - which has created a new problem in that I am not finishing a single story. Well, ok, I finished one of, what, seven new stories. No science fiction involved, or fantasy, but it *is* finished. My problem before, the most obvious one, is that I wasn't writing. Now, it's that I can't seem to complete a story. Part of the problem is that they are almost all idea and no plot, action, dialogue. Ahhh, the beginning writer. 

There's a bit more to it than this though - the plight of every new writer - as I in general, as a person, have a decidedly obvious problem with finishing things. I almost didn't graduate elementary school, middle school, high school, and yes, college because I basically didn't want to finish (with that) school. It got to be ridiculous - for example, the college disaster was partially hanging on one single unfinished ceramic pot, literally. And in middle school, it was English - my absoutely favorite subject. Anyhow, I realized this pattern in time to not completely screw up my Master's degree, but just barely. Another example, non-school related, was that when I used to play tennis, my worst habit was no follow-through when I swung the racket. I would connect with the ball and my arm would just stop there. That's a problem, in tennis and in life. I would tell myself for years that I thrived on pressure and so procrastination was natural and maybe even good for me, as I wouldn't overthink a paper,etc. And there is truth there - but guess what, writers kind of *have* to overthink. It's called outlining and revising and editing. So! A fear to overcome - a big thing in my life that has derailed many a plan.

While I wrestle with this, three quotes to help me (and maybe you) along:

To remind myself that writing regularly *is* progress: "On the whole, anything that gets you writing and keeps you writing is a good thing. Anything that stops you writing is a bad thing. " - Neil Gaiman

A very nice byproduct of getting better at writing: "If people cannot write well, they cannot think well, and if they cannot think well, others will do their thinking for them." - George Orwell 

Lastly, struggling is uncomfortable but fine: "Don't be afraid of silence and the fertility of boredom." - C.S.E. Cooney
