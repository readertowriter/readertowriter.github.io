   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Basically, it comes to this: I want to be a writer. it makes perfect sense in my life, in all ways - creatively, practically, history-wise, mind-wise, and so on. Time is passing though, faster than ever. It&amp;#39;s taken me years+ to get to the point where I can say the first line above to myself, sometimes even out loud, but nonetheless after a few weeks or days of steady progress, I lose focus. I get discouraged. I get lazy. Someone gets sick. Drama. I take up yoga. Whatever. Next thing I know, it&amp;#39;s been weeks since I&amp;#39;ve written. I&amp;#39;m always reading and jotting down ideas, but that is not enough to make me a writer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the idea here is to track the progress, the ups and downs of it all. And for me, I&amp;#39;ve learned that there&amp;#39;s something about putting it online - even if no one else ever reads it much less follows along - that makes me &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to stick to a project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with progress updates, I&amp;#39;ll also talk about books I&amp;#39;ve read and want to read, writing strategies, themes and trends I&amp;#39;m interested in, time management, goal-setting, and basically anything that gets me excited to write enough that I actually write. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s that.&lt;/p&gt;
