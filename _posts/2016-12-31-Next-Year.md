My goals for the new year. Forget yoga goals or garden goals or whatever - *this* is what I want to be doing. ALl this rest will either happen or it doesn't - no biggie - but if these two don't happen, it's hard to see how they *ever* will. No pressure, ha. But seriously, this has to be the year I take myself and my goals seriously.
