It is in fact much easier for us to send machines, cameras...even people, ten million miles out into space than it is to send anything, let alone anyone, ten miles under foot. Going out is always easy, you just set off and go. Going in is never easy, and going deep is quite another matter." - Ursula K. Le Guin, [link](http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/elementals/)
