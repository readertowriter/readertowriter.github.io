"If you ask me why I write under pen names, I'll tell you some very smart, practical reasons -- that it helps clarify audience for someone who writes across genre, that it frees the prolific writer in some ways -- but it also creates a sheep, one small thin veil between the book and me. Note that I didn't say it creates a veil between the work and me. No. The work, the page, the writing, this is what I'm hoping to protect. That point is that I create ways to insulate myself -- even if they aren't effective really in any real way beyond my psyche and its immediate need to write -- and to protect my relationship with the page." - Julianna Baggott, [link](http://bridgetasher.blogspot.com/2014/09/on-kind-of-writers-block-on-not-writing.html)
