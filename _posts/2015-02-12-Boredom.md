title: Boredom
---

No wonder it drives parents, well some parents at least, nuts when kids whine about being bored. Bored? I wish I had time to be bored! 

Only not really, because it just doesn't work for me, boredom. I can daydream fine, but that is not boredom. Sometimes I'm at loss of what to do, but that's not boredom - it's  either because my to-do list is overwhelming or else I'm emotionally out of it for whatever reason and I can't settle on what needs doing next. 

As a kid, I would read every day for hours, or so it seems in my memory, and I do rmeember for sure once my dad said he envied me and that he felt lucky if he read one book for fun each month. I pitied him. That was the exact feeling: pity. And now? Oh, empathy and commiseration. I am making a real effort to read more this year, and so far it's working, but it's still nowhere near enough to what I want and need to do, and everything else gets pushed to the wayside. I'm a horrible juggler it seems.
