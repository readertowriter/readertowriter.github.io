The month of March, I wrote a long leisurely story that now feels like it needs to be set aside for a month or so. Partially I have to research dinosaurs and 'slice of life' stories, but mostly I need some space to think about it and yet not think about it. So, unless another story comes and bops me on the head, I think I will revise a few old ones I wrote last year and see if I can polish them up. And then I need to submit to places - that's my goal for April. Submit, submit, and submit some more.
