So, I have a complete story, about 51,000 words long. Now what? I'm leaving in a week for most of the month of December, and it will be so busy, I will not be able to work on this much, so it seems the perfect time to take the much-lauded step back and let the story kinda simmer in my brain without actively thinking about it, editing it, writing it, whatever. Until then, I'd like to do three things:

1) Make a rough outline of the complete story. I want to see the bones of it, see if the rafters can support the roof, etc etc.

2) I finished the story about a week before NaNoWriMo ended, but still needed to write 10,000 or so words. I've read before that if you finish your story in much less words than it should have (for the format you're writing for, i.e. most novels should be 60,000+ words) then it means your ideas weren't rich enough, or fleshed out enough, or.. But for me, this time, I think it was more that I just really really wantd a complete story and somehow I just found my fingers fast forwarding and my protagonist died. The End. Hm. She may be ressurected, but anyhow, after that, for the last week, I wrote little scenes and bits to put into previous ones. So, with those bits, about 10,000 words worth, I want to fit them in where it seems best so that I can read the entire story from first page to last and see how it reads.

3) Print it out. It will be so very satisfying.

And then I will enjoy my vacation, read a ton, and come back with fresh eyes, ready to work on my story. Yes!
