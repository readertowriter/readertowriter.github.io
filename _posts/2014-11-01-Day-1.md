"People need wild places. Whether or not we think we do, we do. We need to be able to taste grace and know again that we desire it... To be surrounded by a singing, mating, howling commotion of other species, all of which love their loves as much as we do ours, and none of which could possibly care less about us in our place."   
- Barbara Kingsolver
