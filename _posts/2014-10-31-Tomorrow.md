title: Tomorrow is the day!

"Nothing ever begins. There is no first moment; no single world or place from which this or any other story springs. The threads can always be traced back to some earlier tale, and to the tales that preceded that, though as the narrator's voice receds the connections will seem to grow more tenuous, for each age will want the tale told again as if it were its own making."   
- Clive Barker

I have no idea what I'll be writing tomorrow. My slightly-revised plan: Don't overthink it. Just write and you can't go wrong - except if you leave things unfinished. And even then, it's still ok. Writing is the most important part. Write what makes sense, feels right, makes you cry or hum in happiness, or shiver in suspence, whatever. (Do try to finish though.)
