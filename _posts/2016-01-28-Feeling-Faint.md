title: Feeling Faint		
---

I submitted my first story! Just now, some copy-and-paste-ing, a fast google search on cover story etiquette, two deep breaths, and then click. That's all. Click. Such a small sound and easy movement to cover all that built up to it. Oh lordy.

Hence this postm, finally, after eight months of no updates. It felt foolish to write anything here without having actually produced something that I was willing to show to others. Now, with the help of [Submission Grinder](http://thegrinder.diabolicalplots.com/), I will try to not obsess and just wait patiently.

But wait, no, not just wait. I have two more stories to edit, and two more publications to research, one with a deadline two weeks from today. 

Can I do it again? And again? 

I think I can.
