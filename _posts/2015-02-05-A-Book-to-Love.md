"You have kept the absurd idea throughout your training that a knight must be flawless to be worthy. I don't know where you picked this up, for certainly I never said anything of the sort. You conveniently forget Sir Ancelin who slew a dozen of his dearest companions, Sir Actavaron who seduces his best friend's wife, Sir Cobals who stole and lied in the streets of Avyona for a year, and too many others for me to count...A man may be flawed and still good. A man may have committed a fault and still be reckoned worthy. What did you expect? That my training would enable you to behave as a saint in all circumstances?...I tell you this now: for the rest of your life, you shall be haunted by the decisions you took and those you didn't take, by the acts you will wish you had not performed and by those you will wish you had."

and 

"The world is vast. It is full of people, full of doings and battles and magic. Anywhere you go, you will find the world waiting for you."

When you finish a good book, any of the following might occur:

*  one or both of your arms break out in goosebumps,
*  an unsupressable smile crosses your face, you want to hug the book to your chest, 
*  you exhale a large happy sigh you didn't know you were holding, 
*  you put the book down and immediately pick it back up, flipping through it, remembering how good the journey of reading it had been, 
*  you google the author's name on youtube, blogs, wikipedia, and goodreads, searching for interviews, more stories, and books, wondering who this person is who wrote something you love. 

So, read [The Book of Knights](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1583772.The_Book_of_Knights) by Yves Reynard if you loved [Nobody's Son](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/602467.Nobody_s_Son) by Sean Stewart, and vice versa of course.
