"Whoever [the unkown Italian author Elena] Ferrante is, in the novel she is free to invent, to fabricate, to play, to revisit old wounds, to be less than beautiful. This is what writing can do: create a space for the savage within, for the contradictory and the wild, and make it real. There may be no consolation except the art itself, but what a pleasure for those of us who get to read it. I would not want to forget what Ferrante herself so eloquently stated in one of her letters: the mystery of literature is in some ways its difference from the person who wrote it, the unfathomable effacement of self that leads to its creation." - from The Guardian, Oct. 2014, [link](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/31/elena-ferrante-literary-sensation-nobody-knows)

I have felt a little bit of that when writing - and at those times, I can see and feel the appeal of writing, the way it can become an addiction, maybe even.
