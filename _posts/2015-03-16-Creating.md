"My first thought, as a child, was that the artist brings something into the world that didn't exist before, and that he does it without destroying something else. A kind of refutation of the conservation of matter. That still seems to me its central magic, its core of joy." -John Updike, as quoted by Terri Windling, [link](http://www.terriwindling.com/blog/2015/02/magic-of-art.html)
