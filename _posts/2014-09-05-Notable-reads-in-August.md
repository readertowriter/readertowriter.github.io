* ["My Writing Process"](http://kiiniibura.com/2014/06/09/my-writing-process/) by Kiini Ibura Salaam
	I've enjoyed the writing process blog tour that has been going around all summer long, and here is a good one. Two quotes I liked: "Productivity isn’t about fixing what’s lazy or broken about you, it’s about learning the secret combination(s) that free your passion to come out and play. I find it much more productive to look at my blocks and create systems and strategies to work around them rather than commit myself to demolishing them." and "And it is my true belief that you would not have the impulse to create without the ability to fulfill your creativity some form or another. In other words, there is always a way to make work. You just have to puzzle out the right process that will clear the path and let the work emerge."

* [The Goblin Emperor](goodreads.com/book/show/17910048-the-goblin-emperor) by Katherine Addison
	Sometimes you pick up a book and within a few pages, maybe even a few paragraphs, you know you are in for a good read. Though the end was a bit pat, and everyone turned out nice except the obvious bad ones, it was still a total pleasure to read. I especially enjoyed that this was just one book - a companion novel is being considered, but not a sequel. I know fantasy is famous for its multi-volume sagas, but I think standalone books lend more to the imagination - here, it gives me room to wonder at what happens with Maia's impending marriage, does he see his grandfather again, does he figure out how to meditate in privacy, what will his legacy be, etc etc. As with the best of fantasy, the worldbuilding was fantastic but not hitting you over the head with all the detail the author had clearly put into the world.

* [Here Where the Sunbeams are Green](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13533690-here-where-the-sunbeams-are-green) by Helen Phillips
	Very enjoyable middle-grade fiction, with a bit of fantasy, a good mystery, and an environmental message well-done. I thought the beginning was the strongest bit, as often happens. The end was too pat, and I wish there's been some better explanation for the mother's absence, not literally but basically, throughout the story - but I loved the relationship between the two sisters and the setting was fantastic. 

* ["The underground ghetto city of Gaza"](http://www.haaretz.com/mobile/.premium-1.608653?v=AB33D5FF159E93321B0FE9E2A1961EA2) by Amir Nizar Zuabi (via [6 of the Most Beautiful Writings from and for Gaza ](http://arablit.wordpress.com/2014/08/08/6-of-the-most-beautiful-writings-from-and-for-gaza/))
	"Ten years and seven operations later, the mission is completed. Upper Gaza is totally abandoned. All of Gaza has moved underground. Men, women and children, a great mass of people.  

	We dug entire neighborhoods, streets, highways, schools, theaters, hospitals. We dug mirror images of the land above that we abandoned. We gave up on the dream of getting out of the Gaza Strip. On the promises to lift the blockade, to find a solution to the crowdedness and the hunger, and we took action. We, who were attacked from the sky, from the sea, from the fields, who had one-ton bombs dropped on our heads in pointless rounds of killing, have turned our back on life. We, whom the world forgot, decided to pay it back in kind, and forgot it right back.

	Having despaired of the world, of the fear, of the blood, the only refuge left to us was the earth. We buried ourselves alive. "

* ["The Women of Our Occupation"](http://www.strangehorizons.com/2006/20060731/women-f.shtml) by Kameron Hurley
	This was the first of her fiction that I'd read, and considering she just won two Hugos for her non-fiction, I thought I'd give some a try. I liked how grim it got, and the ending was so abrupt, I love that kind of set-up and follow-through.

I'm going to keep better track of what I read throughout the month so that these monthly posts hopefully show a progression of thoughts and themes that interest me.
