The two weeks of this year have passed in a blur. So very busy, and getting good things done, important things, but writing? No. Not even a bit. I'm really not sure how sustainable this life of mine is. I know myself well enough by now to know that if I don't read after x amount of time, or I don't create *something* in x weeks, then I get incurably grumpy, mean, angry, bitter, however you want to call it, or however you feel it.  Writing isn't at that level of need yet, but when I *do* write, my mind feels clearer, my body calmer, and my head full of wonderings and hopes and excitement. Not to romanticize it, geez. Anyhow, I have to find the time to write. I have to.
