“When you write a story, you’re telling yourself the story,” he said. “When you rewrite, your main job is taking out all the things that are not the story.” - Stephen King

I'm currently writing a story that it reaching the tough phase, where it's all scenery and background and great but nothing is really hapenning. Plot is difficult. But on I trudge, and so far, the trudging is, once I get going, fun.
