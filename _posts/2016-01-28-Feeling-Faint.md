title: Feeling Faint		
---

I submitted my first story! Just now, some copy and pasting, a quick google search on cover story etiquette, two quick breaths, and then click. Such a small sound, an easy movement, to cover all that built up to it. Oh lordy.

So, hence this post. It felt foolish to write anything here without having actually produced something that I was willing to show to others. Now, with the help of [Submission Grinder](http://thegrinder.diabolicalplots.com/), I will try to not obsess and just wait patiently.

But wait, no, not just wait. I have two more stories to edit, and two more publications to research, one with a deadline two weeks from today. 

Can I do it again? And again? 

I think I can.
