title: I Want a Fire Lizard
---

Currently I'm reading my way through Kate Elliott's Jaran series. I have some concerns about it, not least being the first half of the first book (which in total is 500+ pages) I had to literally force myself to read, to care at all, but at this point, with book two, I am really enjoying the mix of fantasy and science fiction. 

I remember once participating in a book club online where, when talking about fantasy series, I said I loved Anne McCaffrey as a child, and someone blandly replied, But she never wrote anything but Science Fiction. That made me stop and think. Now, I agree - but it is also true that the feel of the early Pern books, the Harper Hall Trilogy particularly, feel like a neighboring kingdom to Mercedes Lackey's Valdemar books. Dragons (and fire lizards) instead of horses. But technically, science fiction. I find that fascinating. And so here in the Jaran books, it's less cutesy, no companion animals of any type (darn) but the setting is very familiar to fantasy readers. The feel of it is all fantasy. A lesser copy of Robin McKinley's Blue Sword. That kind of thing. That is also the reason I had to slog through for a couple hundred pages - I've read better pure fantasy. 

But then you add in the science fiction - and it's much more pervasive in the second book so far - and that's where I get absolutely caught up. And writing wise, again I'm reminded, that is what I'm interested in: the boundaries - like where fantasy meets science fiction, where science meets magic. Kind of the other end of institial fiction, from what I understand. I love folk tales and fairy tales very much. But to me, it's been done. What draws me is the other end - hard cold facts that bump right into the unknown, where you end up not knowing the difference between the two.
