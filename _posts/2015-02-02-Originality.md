"...beyond which thereâ€™s originality itself, which is what practice is really about in the end..."

"Other than these, we go out anonymous into the insect air and all we are is the dust of colour, brief engineering of wings towards a glint of light on a blade of grass or a leaf in a summer dark."

Both quotes from Ali Smith's [How to Be Both](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20439328-how-to-be-both), absolutely different and maybe too oblique to make sense to anyone else but I like them together. And the book they came from? Really truly great.
