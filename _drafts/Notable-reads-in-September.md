* [We Have Always Lived in the Castle]() by Shirley Jackson

* [Blue Pastures]() by Mary Oliver

	"The words leads us and we follow: what is cute is diminuitive, it is powerlesss, it is capturable, it is trainable, it is ours. It is all a mistake. At our feet are the ferns - savage and resolute they rose, when the race of man was *nowhere* and altogether unlikely ever to be at all, in the terrifying shallos of the first unnamed and unnameable oceans... Nature [is the] total of all of us."	

* ["Story of Your Life"]() by Ted Chiang

	I loved the footnote: "As for this story's theme, the most concise summation of it that I've seen appears in Kurt Vonnegut's introduction to the 25th anniversary edition of *Slaughterhouse-Five*: 'Stepehn Hawking...found it tantalizing that we could not remember the future. But remembering the future is child's play for me now. I know what will become of my helpless, trusting babies because they are grown-ups now. I know how my closest friends will end up because so many of them are retired or dead now... To Stephan Hawking and all others younger than myself I say, ' Be patient. Your future will come to you and lie down at your feet like a dog who know sna dloves you no matter what you are.'""
