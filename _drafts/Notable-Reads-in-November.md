title: Notable Reads in November

* ["The Road to Publication"](http://www.jessieburton.co.uk/the-miniaturist---the-road-to-publication.html) by Jessie Burton
	
	My favorite bits: "Writing will enrage you, but it's supposed to. It's not an escape - it's turning up to face myself. I drive myself crazy just by being conscious - writing is the exploration of this fury..." and "Just keep writing and reading; two acts of autonomy and agency, two channels of air to breathe in deep."

* ["The Inner Child and the Nude Politician"](http://www.ursulakleguin.com/Blog2014.html) by Ursula K. Le Guin

	"To respect and cherish the freshness of perception and the vast, polymorphous potentialities of childhood is one thing. But to say that we experience true being only in childhood and that creatifity is an infantil function - that's something else. I keep meeting this devaluation of growing up in fiction,a nd also in the cult of the Inner Child... However conscious we are of the freedom and awareness and joyfullness we lose as we age, we live a full human life not by stopping at any stage, but by becoming all that is in us to become." 

*["Mrs Sorenson and the Sasquatch"](http://www.tor.com/stories/2014/10/mrs-sorensen-and-the-sasquatch-kelly-barnhill) by Kelly Barnhill

	I really enjoy this writer's non-fiction, in the form of blog posts, and have been meaning to read some fiction by her for a while. This did not disappoint, even though I have zero interest in Sasquatch. The only problem I could see, and you can't really call it a problem, is that the lives were so full of detail, I wanted the story to go on. How does one know when you have a short story idea or a novel idea in your head? This, I think, could have easily been expanded to novel-length.

*["The Husband Stitch"](http://www.granta.com/New-Writing/The-Husband-Stitch) by Carmen Maria Machado
	
	The power of story, especially when it comes to birth and women's experiences: "There is a story about a woman who goes into labour when the attending physician is tired. There is a story about a woman who herself was born too early. There is a story about a woman whose body clung to her child so hard they cut her to retrieve him. There is a story about a woman who heard a story about a woman who birthed wolf cubs in secret. Stories have this way of running together like raindrops in a pond. They are each borne from the clouds separately, but once they have come together, there is no way to tell them apart." 
	

(The last two stories were recommended in a recent A.C. Wise ['Women to Read'](http://www.sfsignal.com/archives/2014/11/guest-post-a-c-wise-on-women-to-read-where-to-start-november-2014-edition/) column in SF Signal. Generally a very good column to follow.)
