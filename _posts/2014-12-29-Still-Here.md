Just back from a very fun and great visit to another continent, and now a little breather before the new year. I have lots of plans and hopes for this year, and writing is a big part of all that. Publishing even more so. Be back soon and in the meantime, a quote I like: 

"Nothing ever begins. There is no first moment; no single world or place from which this or any other story springs. The threads can always be traced back to some earlier tale, and to the tales that preceded that, though as the narrator's voice receds the connections will seem to grow more tenuous, for each age will want the tale told again as if it were its own making." - Clive Barker
