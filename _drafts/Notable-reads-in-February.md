	First interactive fiction story I've ever read. Kinda neat, but frustrating in that I was the kid who read the Choose Your Own Adventure stories with at least half a dozen fingers holding places where I'd had to make a choice and wanted to go back to later and try out the unpicked choice, so this format - where no fingers, digital or literal, can help me - wasn't satisfying.
