I'm a fiction reader for a new online journal! It's pretty great, I read a ton of stories every week and am learning a lot with each batch I go through. I'm also still reading a lot of good short fiction on the side, and reading outside the genre too, which is always beneficial. Plus I love to be reading so much! I've gone through phases of my life when I haven't read a thing in weeks and I get so cranky and irritable. Now, there's so much going on outside of my book life but it's the books that keep me able to handle it all. Woohoo for books, and woohoo for the slush pile - people are cool and brave to even try, and it gives me courage too.
