I used to think waking up early was a sign of a responsible or even virtuous person. I'm definitely a night owl, but always felt some guilt that I had never 'got my act together' and changed my life so I was up at the crack of dawn. Part of that is probably because both my parents seemed like the opposite of night owls, especially my dad. Now though, I know that though I can change my schedule and respond to alarms like any normal person, I really love puttering around at night, when everyone is tucked in bed and the moon is out, etc etc. 

However, I no longer assume waking up early is a sign of virtue - because now I have two kids and I too am waking up at 6:30, 6:15, maybe 7:00 basically every day. Why? Because they wake up then. It's really hard to sleep when someone is babbling and crawling over your body over and over as if you're a mountain and by god they will conquer you. It's really hard to sleep when someone else, say a three year old, is knocking on the door, politely yes, but over and over and over, saying she is very very hungry and needs cereal now. So, we get up. The day begins much earlier than it used to. I no longer feel the guilt of sleeping in until eleven or even ten, and I miss that guilt.
