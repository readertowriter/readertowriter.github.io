I heard back from the second place - rejection. It smarted all the more because it was trying to be a personal rejection, but they got a personal bit of info (that was originally requested of all submissions) totally wrong, so I felt foolish for divulging that bit of info, and anyhow the mood was all easy breezy dismissive. Ah well. I'm sure I'm reading into it, only my second submission after all. 

Since then, though, I wrote two more fragments-that-will-become-stories. Onward and upward.
