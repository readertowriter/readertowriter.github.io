"Men lived here once, & married & fathered children & died here too, generations of them, & now they’re nowt but dust beneath your feet. All their proud voices quiet now, dark their eyes, cold their hearts that laughed once & loved & struggled through their lives...O God O God the world’s a slaughterhouse. Every cobble in the street could be pressed from human bones; every pot on the fire could be made of human clay."    -- [Nobody's Son](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/602467.Nobody_s_Son) by Sean Stewart

Hmm, so I'm realizing that this is definitely a theme/interest/struggle? for me, in my head and in my writing. I'm thinking it's a combination of natural curiosity, wrestling with mortality/immortality ideas and realities, as well as my imagination going crazy. In a good way. So yeah, write about that, ok?
