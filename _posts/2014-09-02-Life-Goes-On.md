[Landscape with The Fall of Icarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape_with_the_Fall_of_Icarus) (circa 1558) by Brug(h)el the Elder (maybe - it's complicated. As is that h in his name - his children, grandchildren, etc have it, but he doesn't - why! Anyhow..)

Two poems were inspired by this painting, the first by W.H. Auden and the second, which I agree with more, by William Carlos Williams.

Musee des Beaux Arts by W. H. Auden

About suffering they were never wrong,  
The old Masters: how well they understood  
Its human position: how it takes place  
While someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully along;  
How, when the aged are reverently, passionately waiting  
For the miraculous birth, there always must be  
Children who did not specially want it to happen, skating  
On a pond at the edge of the wood:  
They never forgot  
That even the dreadful martyrdom must run its course  
Anyhow in a corner, some untidy spot  
Where the dogs go on with their doggy life and the torturer's horse  
Scratches its innocent behind on a tree.  

In Breughel's Icarus, for instance: how everything turns away  
Quite leisurely from the disaster; the ploughman may  
Have heard the splash, the forsaken cry,  
But for him it was not an important failure; the sun shone  
As it had to on the white legs disappearing into the green  
Water, and the expensive delicate ship that must have seen  
Something amazing, a boy falling out of the sky,  
Had somewhere to get to and sailed calmly on.

Landscape with the Fall of Icarus by William Carlos Williams

According to Brueghel  
when Icarus fell  
it was spring  

a farmer was ploughing  
his field  
the whole pageantry  

of the year was  
awake tingling  
with itself  

sweating in the sun  
that melted  
the wings' wax  

unsignificantly  
off the coast  
there was  

a splash quite unnoticed  
this was  
Icarus drowning

In the first poem, Auden writes as if people don't care what happened because they are callous to the suffering of others, but in the Williams poem, it's more that while tragedy happens, there is beauty as well - beauty that in a way causes the suffering perhaps (i.e. the year becoming 'awake tingling' with the hot sun melting Icarus's wings, though clearly most of this was Icarus's fault) - but beauty nonetheless. Life goes on. And that is a cruel thing, as anyone who has dealt with grief and death can feel, but at the same time, it's hopefull too. It's humbling to feel insignificant, outrageous even, but it's also a relief. 

So, that is one type of fantasy I want to write - the life that goes on, the daily life, 'slice of life', the stuff that is usually in the background of epic fantasy but pushed to the foreground for once. How perhaps horribleness is happening just beyond the forest, wizards are gathered, or a battle is being lost - but today, someone's baby learned to walk and someone else's favorite rose bush just bloomed. Yes.
