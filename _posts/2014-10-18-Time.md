"Time is the coin of your life. You spend it. Do not allow others to spend it for you." - Carl Sandburg


Even though I am not writing much lately - just little bits here and there, maybe a few hundred words at a time -, it still feels like I am on the right path. I trust that feeling. It's helped me so much over the years, never leading me wrong. I am reading a ton, widely. That helps. But mostly I feel like things are solidifying. No longer some nebulous thing I can't even bring myself to say out loud without a pause first. It's becoming a solid base, I can feel that. 

Now. With that said, I really have to get back to writing. And finishing writing. But for tonight, I'm happy.
