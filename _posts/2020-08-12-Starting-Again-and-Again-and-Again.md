## They Say the Trick is to Not Stop

So, somehow, impossibly, we are in mid-August, with the year half over. A year and a half has passed since I wrote a thing here, since I had a computer that could even halfway work, since I had time and stability and space to sit and write. That's not to say I haven't found bits of space here and there, and I've been reading, thank goodness, more than in 2018 and, so far, more than 2019. Still, I want more. I'm feeling ambitious in a way I've never let myself feel ambitious about writing.

Watch this space. (I say, sending this out to space where no one will probably ever read it. But body, soul, do you hear? Watch this space.)
