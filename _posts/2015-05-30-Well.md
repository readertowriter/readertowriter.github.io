One thing that has changed in the past nine months or so since I started this, one noticeable change, is that I regularly get ideas for stories and plots and scenes and *then* I want to write them down. So I do. I must have dozens now of little bits and pieces in Scrivener and SimpleNote (my apps of choice) and when I look back at them, they're not bad. It's such baby steps for me, with lots of crawling backwards and stumbling and long long pauses with my thumb stuck in my mouth, that kind of thing - - but there *is* progress. So, 800 words yesterday, written in the middle of the night. Not a complete story, it never is, and interrupted by a baby that somehow knew I was doing soemthing besides gazing adoringly at her or offering her food, but I'll take it. It's something. My little hoard of ideas grows, ever so slowly, but I'll take it.
