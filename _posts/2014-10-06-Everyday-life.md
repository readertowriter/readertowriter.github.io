"Be invested in the idea of ordinary life." -Claire Dederer, [link](http://www.chasingray.com/archives/2014/07/be_invested_in_the_idea_of_ord.html)

My life for the past few years has been full of schedules - they vary, depending on where we are and how old the babies are, but they are there. In capital letters really. Resepct the schedule! 

I was very resistant at first. After so many years of schooling, where the schedule is dictated by others, and then years of no scheduling except what I set for myself, I wanted none of that. Neither anyone imposing a schedule on me, nor even me filling up my own days. But here we are - and it works. It's interesting, when one creates a schedule, how the schedule takes on a life of its own once set. There are many times when I just want to skip it all, but no, it demands and guilts and rages. And besides, the children just thrive with schedules. 

All this must be why most of the stories I've written lately are full of day-to-day routines from an adult's viewpoint. I have a book (don't we all) that I've been working on since NaNoWriMo 2012, and for the longest time my protagonist is a 5 (sometimes 7) year old. Now I'm thinking about switching it around, permanently I'm not sure, maybe just a few chapters?, to an adult's point-of-view, one who is one of the caretakers of this young kid. And so, naturally, I'm going to open with a list of things the caretaker is doing and thinking about, on any ordinary day. Multitasking and cooking and cleaning and worrying and planning and reminding oneself to not forget this and that, little pep talks here and there, etc etc. I'm really not super interested right now in reading about thirteen-year olds or twenty-two year olds discovering they are the lost heirs of whatever or going on giant epic quests - I'm more interested in how a parent parents and yet stays themselves, or rather grows and even wins the whatever they were hoping for pre-parenthood. To me, that's fascinating. How people cope and live and even thrive in small ways, day after day. Oh and magic, of course. Magic always. It remains to be seen if others think this is fascinating as well.

And yup, planning on doing NaNoWriMo again this year. Last year I had a newborn, so it was a no-go. Good excuse, but none such this year. I'm glad.
