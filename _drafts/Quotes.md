Of course, I live more than one life all the time anyway. Don't we all who read books?" - Mary Oliver





"Our lives are fittered away by detail... Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity!" - Henry David Thoreau (Walden)


"Do not try to satisfy your vanity by teaching a great many things. Awaken people's curiosity. It is enough to open minds, do not overload them. Put there just a spark. If there is some good inflammable stuff, it will catch fire." - Anatole France

"The verb 'to wonder' communicates the receptive state of marveling as well as the active desire to know, to inquire..." - Maria Werner


"[While walking, a] new thought often seems like a feature of the landscape that was there all along, as though thinking were traveling rather than making." -Rebecca Solnit

"Always in big woods, when you leave familiar ground and step off alone to a new place, there will be, along with feelings of curiosity and excitement, a little nagging of dread. It is the ancient fear of the unkown, and it is your bond with the wilderness you are going into. What you are doing is exploring. You are undering the first experience, not of the place, but of yourself in that place." - Wendell Berry

"Distant places give us refuge in territories where our histories aren’t so deeply entrenched and we can imagine other stories, other selves, or just drink up quiet and respite." -Rebecca Solnit

"It's easy for storytellers to think stories are wonderful, but some stories burden and curse you; some stories you're better without." -Rebecca Solnit

" I'm interested in how a narrative can be complete, have form and satisfaction, without that sense of tidying it all up or shutting it all down. Because the questions are richer than any answers could be, and letting the questions stay, not be nailed down and shut up by answers is important. You can imagine the protagonist, imagine yourself as a sort of question, or quest, and to say that it's over is to say it's been answered adequately. Toward the end of the book, I wrote, "As I was approaching this chapter, I woke up in the middle of the night and thought something I should have written down at the time. The empty shell of it that washed up on the shores of morning was to the effect that sometimes an extraordinary or huge question comes along and we try to marry it off to a mediocre answer. Essayists too face the temptation of a neat ending, the point when you bring the boat in to shore and tie it to the dock and give up the wide sea. The thread is cut and becomes the ribbon with which everything is tied up, a sealed parcel: the end. It's easy to do, and I've done it again and again, sometimes with a sense of betrayal of the complexity of what came before, and sometimes when I hadn't done it, an editor asked for the giftwrap and ribbon. What if we only wanted openings, the immortality of the unfinished, the uncut thread, the incomplete, the open door and the open sea?" - Rebecca Solnit

"the end of all our exploring / Will be to arrive where we started /And know the place for the first time." -t.s. eliot

"Creation is always in the dark because you can only do the work of making by not quite knowing what you’re doing, by walking into darkness, not staying in the light. Ideas emerge from edges and shadows to arrive in the light, and though that’s where they may be seen by others, that’s not where they’re born." - Rebecca Solnit

"Ultimately, I believe that slowness is an act of resistance, not because slowness is a good in itself but because of all that it makes room for, the things that don’t get measured and can’t be bought." —Rebecca Solnit 

"In the end, people don't view their life as merely the average of all its moments - which, after all, is mostly nothing much plus some sleep. For human beings, life is meaningful because it is a story. A story has a sense of a whole, and its arc is determined by the significant moments, the ones where something happens. Measurements of people's minute-by-minute levels of pleasure and pain miss this fundamental aspect of human existence. A seemingly happy life may be empty. A seemingly difficult life may be devoted to a great cause. We have purposes larger than ourselves. Unlike your experiencing self - which is absored in the moment - your remembering self is attempting to recognize not onnly the peaks of joy and valleys of misery but also how the story works out as a whole. That is profoundly affected by how things ultimately turn out. Why would a football fan let a few flubbed minutes at the end of the game ruin three hours of bliss? Because a football game is a story. And in stories, endings matter."

"It is more of a jump, but I find that more interesting in many ways. The irruption of the supernatural into our world is a much more enticing notion to explore than the same thing happening in some past time, or in a wholly imaginary world. It is more interesting for the writer, though not necessarily for the reader." - Elizabeth Hand
