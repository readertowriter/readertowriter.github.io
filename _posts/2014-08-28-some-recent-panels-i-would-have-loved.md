category: conferences

A wishlist:


* East, West and Everything Between: A Roundtable on Latin@ Speculative Fiction: *"Are there insurmountable differences in regional Latinidad?... Can we build platform in two languages (and if so, how)?"* 

* The Difference Between Magic and Science: *"In an interview with Avi Solomon, Ted Chiang proposed that "The difference between magic and science is at some level a difference between the universe responding to you in a personal way, and the universe being entirely impersonal." ...Are there magic systems that are entirely impersonal, and if so, are they indistinguishable from science and technology?"* 

* Dystopian Economies: *"This stand-alone follow-up talk [from the previous year's ReaderCon] will focus on dystopian economies. Stott will discuss what corporate states could look like (essentially, what happens if current multinationals get even more powerful and/or develop space programs)..."* 

* When the Magic Returns: *"The "return" of magic into a mundane world is one of very few ways in which we see fantasy set in the future. Why is this? What makes fantasy and futurity so incompatible? Why is the return of magic so often associated with apocalypse, while its banishment is usually the consequence of scientific or industrial progress?"* 

* Plot Without Conflict: *"In Western writing, conflct is considered essential to plot. The classic three- and five-act structures taught in writing courses and workshops revolve around a central conflict. But does plot require conflict?...What can writers steeped in Western notions of plot conflict learn from a careful analysis of alternate structures?"* 

* Russian Traditions of Science Fiction and Fantasy: *"...examining authors such as Nikolai Gogol, Mikhail Bulgakov, Alexei Tolstoi, the Strugatsky brothers, Ludmila Petrushevskaya, and Victor Pelevin. Does Russian SF merely thread genre tropes through the Russian world outlook?"* 

All the above panels were from ReaderCon, held this past July in Boston. The entire program and more info can be found [here](http://www.readercon.org/program.htm). 

Seeing the panels lined up like this helps me see the connections between them and it helps to hone my compass point, a direction to go with the writing I am trying to do. Specifically: magic vs/and science, the "return" of magic, especially the quotations, and plot without conflict. New writers are often cautioned against trying new or unusual story structures until they get better, but whatever to all that. I don't have the time to write stuff that isn't interesting to me.

One day I will attend ReaderCon and hopefully such good panels and discussions will be going on then too.
